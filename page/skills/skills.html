                                I have experience in HTML and have used it to create multiple websites.
                                I am familiar with HTML5 and the new features it has to offer.
                                The reason I still use HTML is because it is the backbone of all websites.
                                Also I have experience in using HTML with CSS and JavaScript and feel that I understand these over other langauges.

                                On top of making really good code structures, I also have experience in CSS.
                                I have to style websites and really show off my creative side in designing.
                                CSS always came easy to me and I feel that I can design a website that looks good and is easy to use.
                                Using CSS has really helped me understand the infinite possibilities of web design.

                                JavaScript is a language that I have been using for a while now.
                                I have used it to create multiple websites and applications.
                                Mainly I like the math side of JavaScript and how it can be used to create really cool things.
                                One project that I am really proud of is the Advanced Calculator where I did more then just simple math functions.
                                I used JavaScript to create a calculator that can do advanced math functions like sin, cos, tan, and more.

                                When it coems to Python, I have a love/hate relationship with it.
                                Sometimes it is hard to go from a syntax like JavaScript to Python.
                                It usually takes me a couple of minutes to get used to the syntax and then I am good to go.
                                I mainly use Python for the back-end of my projects and create really good graphs and data visualizations.
                                I also use Python for math and data analysis.
                                I have used Python to create a couple of projects that I am really proud of.
