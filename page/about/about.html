                    <p class="about_info">
                        My love for programming has grown over the years after starting my freshman year in high school.
                        I first started coding using Scratch, which is a block-based programming language.
                        I then moved on to HTML and CSS, which I used to create my first website.
                        The love for developing has further expanded to Javascript and Python.
                        I consider myself a Junior Fullstack Developer, as I have experience in both front-end and back-end development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The reason I consider myself a Junior Fullstack Developer is because I haven't mastered any languages yet.
                        Even though I can program in HTML, CSS and JavaScript fluently, there is still room to learn.

                        My college roadmap is to attend Blue Ridge Community College and James Madison University.
                        I plan to get my general education courses out of the way at BRCC, and then transfer to JMU.
                        I have already been accepted to JMU from a program called BRCC2JMU.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My major that I plan on pursuing is computer science.
                        I have always had a love for computers and technology ever since I was a kid.
                        After college I plan on getting a job as a software developer or web developer.
                        Overall, I wish to open a company that focuses on making websites and applications for small businesses or individuals.

                    <p class="about_info">
                        When it comes to music, I love all types.
                        I am really myself when I am listening to music.
                        Music helps me focus when I have a task to do, and always keeps me going.
                        Mainly I listen to music when programming because it helps me bring out my creative side.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My programming tunes can either be fast paced or slow paced, depending on the task at hand.
                        I feel that music is a big part of my life ever since I was a kid.
